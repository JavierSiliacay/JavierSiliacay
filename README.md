# 👋 Hi there, I'm Javier Siliacay!

### 🎓 C/C++ Arduino Enthusiast | 🌍 Philippines | 🏫 USTP Student

I'm a passionate embedded systems developer and Arduino creator from the Philippines. I study at **USTP**, where I love building innovative hardware projects using **C/C++** and **Arduino/ESP-based microcontrollers**. I live for clean code, working with sensors, and making ideas come to life.
